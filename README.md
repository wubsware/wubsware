I'm a little new here...
===
- I code threat detection tools for a cybersecurity company currently. All very 🤫| 🤐| 🔐. So I can't share a large portion of what I spend most of my time building and working on.
- Mainly write Go, but I do dabble with Python and React (w/Typescript ofc) from time to time.
- I'm an outdoorsy guy. Love to unplug.
